# Mini SOC Lab Project

This project simulates a small Security Operations Center (SOC) environment to demonstrate network security, endpoint monitoring, and incident response using virtual machines.

## Lab Components
- pfSense: Network firewall/router
- Windows Server 2022: Active Directory Domain Controller
- Windows 10 Workstation: Domain client
- BadBlood: Misconfiguration simulation tool
- Sysmon: System monitoring and logging
- CrowdSec: Threat detection and response

## Setup Overview
1. Configure pfSense for network traffic management.
2. Install Windows Server 2022 and configure Active Directory.
3. Deploy Windows 10 workstation and join the domain.
4. Install BadBlood to simulate misconfigurations.
5. Configure Sysmon for detailed event logging.
6. Install CrowdSec for automated detection and response.

## Learning Outcomes
- SOC environment setup and operation
- Endpoint and network monitoring
- Threat detection and misconfiguration analysis
- Incident response workflow understanding
